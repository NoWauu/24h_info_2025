# 24h INFO 2025 repo of the "It's over 9000 requests" team
###### which ended at 29th place over 39 teams overall

## 1st part : Algorithm

I (NoWay_y) personally did only one chall over 10 but completed it with a Rust program and not using any AI/LLM to do it (see [here](https://github.com/NoWauu/24h_info_2025/tree/main/Algo/Rust/apps/main/src/retrogaming.rs)).
We ended at 27th place due to a correction about 20 minutes before the end of the part, even though we finished 4 hours early.

## 2nd part : Web

We're not gonna talk about this part... right ?

## 3rd part : Cybersec

see [CTFer.io repo](https://github.com/ctfer-io/24hiut2025/tree/main/challenges) for challenges

This part was really fun, it was a CTF with challenges available at different skill level.
I (NoWay_y still) took the [Sodastream chall](https://github.com/ctfer-io/24hiut2025/tree/main/challenges/forensic/sodastream) and [Kubra chal](https://github.com/ctfer-io/24hiut2025/tree/main/challenges/infra/kubrac), which I ended not finishing either of them :(

Sodastream was a packet analysis chall to extract some base64 data, which can then be decoded into a XORed flag. I was only missing the unXOR part to complete it
Kubra was a Kubernetes + RBC chall where you should use `command injection` into `kubectl` to exploit a pod with too much permissions and extract the flag from there

This was an overall great experience. Can't wait next year to redo that in Montpellier (maybe)
